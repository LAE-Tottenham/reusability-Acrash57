from Func2 import guess_gender, weird_weather_bot, postcode, ellipsis, CatFact, GetWeather


# After you have written the reusable functions, answer the following:
# Questions:
# 1. What are the preconditions for your code not to break?
# Make sure inputs are validated and to repeat the code if the postcode is not on the website
# 2. Validate the user's input based on your preconditions.
# 3. Why was it useful to use reusable components in this case? Please mention at least 2 reasons and don't forget to contextualise.
# You would have less lines of code as functions are used mutliple times which removes unnecessary lenght and complexity
# This is shown as the elipsis function removes the need for it to be repeated as the function can just be outputed twice
# If code is reused then the code will be more reliable as it is old code that is already tried and tested
# This is shown through the copying and slight modification of the if statement for the reply of gender if Y/N

# Further Tasks:
# 1. Put your functions in seperate appropriate files and import them in.
# Func2.py
# 2. Make sure all of your functions (except the main one) only do ONE thing or process.
# COMPLETED
# 3. Add your own twist to the code.
# COMPLETED 

# Extension:
# Add the following apis as reusable components and use them in your code:
